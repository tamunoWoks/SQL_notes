-- DROP DATABASE Statement

-- The DROP DATABASE statement in SQL is used to delete an entire database, including all of its tables, data, views, indexes, and other objects contained within it. 
-- This action is irreversible, meaning that once the database is dropped, all of its contents are permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

-- Syntax:
DROP DATABASE database_name;
-- database_name: The name of the database you want to drop.
