-- DROP DATABASE Statement

-- The DROP DATABASE statement in SQL is used to delete an entire database, including all of its tables, data, views, indexes, and other objects contained within it. 
-- This action is irreversible, meaning that once the database is dropped, all of its contents are permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

-- Syntax:
DROP DATABASE database_name;
-- database_name: The name of the database you want to drop.


-- Example:
DROP DATABASE my_database;

-- Considerations
-- Permissions: Only users with the necessary privileges (typically DBA or equivalent) can execute this statement.
-- Active Connections: Some database systems require you to close all active connections to the database before dropping it.
-- Check Existence: To avoid errors if the database does not exist, you can use the IF EXISTS clause.

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS my_database;
-- Always double-check before executing this command, especially in a production environment, as it will completely remove the database and all its contents.
