-- TEMP TABLES

-- Temporary tables in SQL are special types of tables that are created and used to store intermediate results temporarily within a session or a transaction. 
-- They are useful for breaking down complex queries into simpler steps, storing intermediate results, and improving performance in scenarios where data needs to be reused within a session.
