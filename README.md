# SQL_notes
These are my SQL lesson notes used in teaching SQL to a few young tech enthusiasts.

## NOTES
- It is good practice to terminate every query with a semi-colon to tell the SQL engine where a statement ends.
  This is particularly important when executing multiple SQL statements in one script or batch.
- Math in SQL follows the PEMDAS order of operation for operator precedence. 
- PEMDAS => Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
