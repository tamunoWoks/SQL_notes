-- TRIGGERS

-- In SQL, triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed or "triggered" when certain events occur in a database. 
-- Triggers can be set to run before or after an insert, update, or delete operation on a table. 
-- They are commonly used to enforce business rules, maintain audit trails, or synchronize related tables.
